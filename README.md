🏁 Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
💻 Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
🗄️ MySQL server set up and running.
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-site.git
cd quiz-site
2. Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory and provide the necessary environment variables (use .env.example as a template):
DB_HOST: Database host (usually localhost)
DB_USER: Your MySQL username
DB_PASSWORD: Your MySQL password
DB_NAME: The name of the database you will use
Start the Backend Server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
3. Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Frontend Development Server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
4. Set Up the Database
Import the MySQL Database:
The database file is located in the database directory. Use the following command to import it into your MySQL server:
bash
Copy code
mysql -u your_username -p your_database < database/code-ia-mysql-database.sql
Update Database Credentials:
Make sure the credentials in your backend .env file match your MySQL configuration.
🧪 Testing the Application
Once everything is set up, you can start testing the application by:

🌐 Accessing the frontend at http://localhost:3000.
🔐 Registering or logging in (once authentication is implemented).
📝 Taking quizzes, receiving feedback, and tracking your progress (future features).
