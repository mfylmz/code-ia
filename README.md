## 🏁 Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **💻 Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
- **🗄️ MySQL** server set up and running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/mfylmz/code-ia
cd code-ia
\`\`\`

### 2. Set Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd backend
   \`\`\`
2. **Install the dependencies**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and provide the necessary environment variables (use `.env.example` as a template):
   - `DB_HOST`: Database host (usually `localhost`)
   - `DB_USER`: Your MySQL username
   - `DB_PASSWORD`: Your MySQL password
   - `DB_NAME`: The name of the database you will use
4. **Start the Backend Server**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd ../frontend
   \`\`\`
2. **Install the dependencies**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`
3. **Start the Frontend Development Server**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm start
   \`\`\`
   The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Set Up the Database

1. **Import the MySQL Database**:  
   The database file is located in the `database` directory. Use the following command to import it into your MySQL server:
   \`\`\`bash
   mysql -u your_username -p your_database < database/code-ia-mysql-database.sql
   \`\`\`
2. **Update Database Credentials**:  
   Make sure the credentials in your backend `.env` file match your MySQL configuration.

## 🧪 Testing the Application

Once everything is set up, you can start testing the application by:

- 🌐 Accessing the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
- 🔐 Registering or logging in (once authentication is implemented).
- 📝 Taking quizzes, receiving feedback, and tracking your progress (future features).
